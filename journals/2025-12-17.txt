Message: Stay consistent, keep learning!
Learnings: Today I learned the git branches


syntax

note: adding branch should be in the main tree!!!

git branch <name of the new branch>
git branch dev

git checkout <name of the branch> - this is for changing /switching branches
git checkout dev (old syntax)
git switch dev (modern syntax)

git add <name of the file that you want to add in the branch>
git add test.txt

git add <name of the folder that you want to add in the branch>
git add journals/

git status - checking of the status of your git
git branch - showing the list of the branches

if the git is just new, the main branch is name as "master". to renam it as main do this syntax
git branch -m master <new name - which is should be the main>
git branch -m master main


to list the current file inside a branch
git ls-tree -r --name-only <name of the branch>
git ls-tree -r --name-only dev

git log - to check the logs
git show <commit-hash>
