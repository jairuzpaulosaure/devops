Message: Stay consistent, keep learning!
Learnings:


Topic: Security Group Rules & IP Restrictions

Key Learnings:

 - Security Group act as EC2 firewalls
 - 0.0.0.0/0 allows global access and is risky
 - /32 restricts access to one public IP
 - AWS "My IP" auto-detects current network IP
 - multiple IPs can be safely allowed via multiple rules

DevOps Insights:
 Secure access should be explicit, not convenient.
