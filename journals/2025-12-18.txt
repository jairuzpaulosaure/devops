Merging


make sure first that you are in the main branch
git switch main <name of the main branch>


then check git status first to know if there is uncommit changes
if yes, do git commit

if already okay

do the merging now
git merge dev


to resolve conflicts just do the git add <file / folders> then
git commit


to check the merged history
git log --oneline --graph --all
