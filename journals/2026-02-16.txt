Topic: Creating Public & Private Subnets

What I did:
-Created 2 subnets inside custom VPC
 - Public 10.0.1.0/24
 - Private 10.0.2.0/24

Key Learnings:
- Subnets must fit inside VPC CIDR
- Public vs private distinction is based on routing
- Instances in public subnet can get internet via IGW
- Private subnet is isolated unless NAT gateway added later

DevOps Insight:
- Subnets shape security zones - public for clients, private for internals.
